Andy Murray just won Britain the Davis Cup


If you think that US men's tennis has been [going through a dry spell](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/american-men-may-be-about-to-dominate-world-tennis-again/), spare a thought for British tennis fans. 

Sunday's [3-1 victory over Belgium](http://espn.go.com/tennis/story/_/id/14248587/andy-murray-leads-great-britain-first-davis-cup-title-1936-victory-david-goffin) in the Davis Cup final was Great Britain's first victory in the tournament in 79 years.

Much of the credit for Sunday's victory has gone to Andy Murray. Other players in the British team have won points at important moments, including against the US: back in March, [journeyman James Ward beat John Isner](http://espn.go.com/blog/espntennis/post/_/id/1647/john-isners-loss-creates-more-u-s-concerns) (at the time ranked ninety places higher by the ATP) to put Great Britain 2-0 up, effectively sending the team through to the quarter-final. Yet of the twelve points won by Great Britain since March, Andy Murray won eleven -- eight in singles matches, and three in doubles matches with older brother Jamie. 

It's unusual for a Davis Cup-winning team to be so reliant on a single player. To show that, I got information on all Davis Cup singles matches since 1968 from Jeff Sackman's excellent [results and rankings archive](https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_atp). For each cup-winning country, I calculated the total number of points won in singles matches by that country, and the proportion of those points contributed by each player. I've included information on all matches, including some dead rubbers on the third day. I could exclude the dead rubbers if there was good information on the doubles matches, but there isn't. Excluding the doubles matches doesn't really affect the conclusions, since Murray, playing alongside his brother Jamie, was also excellent in the doubles matches.

The table below shows the twenty most valuable players across all Davis Cup-winning teams. You'll notice how the number of points won by the cup-winning team isn't always the same. In particular, before 1981 the title holders didn't have to play in the intermediate stages of the tournament, but only in a special "challenge round".

Well known players from smaller countries stick out in the list -- the Bjorgs and the Berdychs of this world. 
It's no surprise to see Novak Djokovic feature: the Serb's Davis Cup win in 2010 began an incredible run of form for a player [some regard as](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/djokovic-and-federer-are-vying-to-be-the-greatest-of-all-time/) the GOAT. 

Djokovic, however, was aided by Janko TipsareviÄ‡ and Viktor Troicki, two top-twenty players in their day. 
Murray has won the Davis Cup for Britain almost single-handedly. 
The only player that comes close is Croatia's Ivan Ljubicic who, like Murray, also played an important role in his country's Davis Cup doubles team, managing to defeat the Bryan brothers in their World Group 1st round clash.

Murray has said that the Davis Cup win is his most emotional moment in tennis yet, surpassing his 2014 Wimbledon triumph (which also ended a ridiculously long British wait for a male champion). The Davis Cup is something of an oddity -- a team competition in a sport that, for the most part, is composed of individual rivalries. For Murray, it's stranger still: it's likely he'd rather play for a Scottish Davis Cup team rather than a British one. Tennis in Britain owes him a lot: can it be long before commentators start referring to Sir Andrew Murray?
